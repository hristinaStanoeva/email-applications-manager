# The project
       The main aim is to deliver a system, capable to facilitate tracking, monitoring and processing customer loan applications coming to the bank via e-mail. 


## Functionalities
---

### User authentication

       User authentication is performed by ASP.NET Identity authentication. Users cannot register in the application but are created by another user with “Manager” rights. There are two types of roles - Manager and Operator


### Loan Application format

       No specific email format was defined so far – mail can be in any encoding, HTML or pure text, with or without attachments. Each email may contain a single loan application.

### Email registration 

       Emails are pulled on regular intervals (1 min) from Gmail API. Gmail inbox and system DB are always synchronized. As soon as email is read from Gmail API it is recorded in the system DB. All incoming emails are registered with unique ID automatically within the system. 


## Email/Application statuses
---

 - Not reviewed – default status – all new emails are classified as such. 

 - Invalid application – all email which does not contain loan applications must be marked by operator in such status. Only employees with “Manager” rights can return the email in “Not reviewed” status.

-  New – all emails must be reviewed and only the one contains valid loan application will be set by employee with “New” status. 

- Open – status marked for under processing – in order to set to “Open” status, the system requests **customer name**, **customer ID/EGN** and **customer phone information**  to be fulfilled by the bank employee. 
Respective formal system control of the provided data is applied – client-side, server-side validation.

 - Closed - status of the email when the application is set approved or rejected

## Statuses flow
---

Possible statuses transition depends on granted user/operator rights. They should be as follow:

- Operators
  - Not reviewed **-->** Invalid Application
  - Not reviewed **-->** New
  - New **-->** Open 
  - Open **-->** Closed (allowed only if the application was set in Open status by the same operator)

- Managers
  - Not reviewed **<-->** Invalid Application
  - Not reviewed **<-->** New
  - New **<-->** Open (regardless who put the application in Open status)
  - Open **<-->** Closed (regardless who put the application in Open status)
  - Closed **-->** New 

### Email/Application record

        Body of emails under “Not Review” status are omitted and not stored within the system DB. As soon as email is set with status New – the body of the email is recorded in DB as well.
        - Minimal set of application record
           - Sender 
           - Date received 
           - Subject
           - Body 
           - Count of attachments and total (sum) size of attachments (in Mb)
           - Customer unique ID / EGN – filled by bank employee / agent when change from New->Open status 
           - Customer contact phone – filled by bank employee / agent when change from New->Open status
           - Date/Time of initial registration within the system
           - Date/Time when the application was set in current status 
           - Date/Time when the application was set in terminal status (Closed or Invalid Application)

# Architecture
 - Web Application (MVC) + Business Layer + Data Layer

## Logging
 ### Serilog 
All actions (status changes) are logged with information set 
 - TimeStamp – Date?
 - Action performed (status change, etc.)
 - User performed the action

## Database
 - Azure Database

 ## Backend
 - .NET CORE 2.2
 - Entity Framework Core

## Security 
- Secure data communication between all “layers” - HTTPs
- Data encryption for confidential customer data. 
- Resistant to attacks like cross-site scripting, SQL injection, buffer overflow, session hijacking etc.
   - Input validation performed on server and client side
   - Error messages displayed to user, customer or third parties do not provide sensitive information on data or system
